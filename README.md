# Car Rental System

## Overview

The **Car Rental System** is a console-based Java application that simulates a car rental service. It allows customers to rent cars for a specified number of days, providing functionality for renting, returning cars, and managing car availability.

### Features

- Add and manage cars in the rental system.
- Register customers for renting cars.
- Calculate the rental cost based on the number of days.
- Rent available cars and mark them as unavailable during the rental period.
- Return cars and update their availability status.
- Display information about the rental process and final price.

## Project Structure

- **Car Class**: Represents a car in the rental system with attributes like `carId`, `brand`, `model`, and `basePricePerDay`. Includes methods to manage car rental status.

- **Customer Class**: Represents a customer with attributes like `customerId` and `name`.

- **Rental Class**: Represents a rental transaction, associating a `Car` and a `Customer` for a specific number of days.

- **CarRentalSystem Class**: The main class managing all cars, customers, and rentals. It contains functionality for adding cars, renting them, and returning them.

- **Main Class**: The entry point for the program, where cars are added to the system, and the menu is launched for users to interact with the system.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
    - Basic understanding of how to run Java applications.

2. **Steps to Run**:
    - Clone or download the project to your local machine.
    - Open the project in your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
    - Run the `Main` class to start the application.
    - Follow the prompts in the console to rent or return cars.

3. **Menu Options**:
    - `Rent a Car`: Allows a user to rent a car by entering their name, selecting a car, and specifying the number of days.
    - `Return a Car`: Allows a user to return a rented car by providing the car ID.
    - `Exit`: Exits the application.

## Future Improvements

- Add a user interface (UI) for a better user experience.
- Implement a database to persist customer and car data.
- Add more features like discounts, insurance options, and a wider selection of cars.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used to build the system.
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit to compile and run the code.
